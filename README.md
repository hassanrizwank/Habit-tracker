# Habit-tracker
Build a habit tracker in C in my first-semester programming course.

It works by taking in all the habits you need to work on and creating a record of how much of that habit you accomplished daily.
The simulation provides some statistics after the desired habit period is over.

This was the programming course completion project in my first semester.
